## Optimizations
Users add doggo details. 
<p>-Accounts can be flagged to distinguish dogs with health notes</p>
<p>-Pets can be assigned to groups based on day of the week for daily tracking</p>

## Lessons Learned:
Still new to React and short on time. Don't think I'll use db.json server in the future. Next commit will continue allocation page and add more functionality to Details page. Also want to add designated error page.

## In the terminal, begin by running:

`npm run server`

Starts the db.json server that holds the data

## Open a 2nd terminal(bash), run:

`npm start`

Starts the development server.
Server will open app in browser automatically. If it does not, 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
